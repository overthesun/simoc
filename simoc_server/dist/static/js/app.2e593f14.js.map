Therefore, a 300 watt solar panel on Earth would generate only 100 watts on Mars. This means you will need 3x more panels to produce the same amount of electric power.</p>\n                <p>Keep in mind that not only do you need ample power for all electric devices by day, but also to charge the batteries to operate many of the same devices by night.

The surface of the Earth receives on average 1120 W/m2 energy from the Sun. On Mars, the surface receives on average 590 W/m2. This is then reduced by 30% solar panel efficiency for 177 W/m2 x 2 sq-meters = 354 W/m2.</p>\n                <p><i>POWER is required for all simulated missions.</i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class='reference-item-entry'><a class='reference-link' href=\"#\" @click=\"SETACTIVEREFENTRY('Table')\">Table Of Contents</a></div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='reference-item' v-if=\"getActiveRefEntry === 'PowerStorage'\">\n            <div class='reference-item-title'>Power Storage</div>\n            <div class='reference-item-entry'>\n                <p>While <a class='reference-link' href=\"#\" @click=\"SETACTIVEREFENTRY('PowerGeneration')\">solar PV panels</a> generate power by day, it is the batteries that provide power at night.
