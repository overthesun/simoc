As SIMOC does not currently simulate psycho-social interactions, you may consider the volume of a larger space as an atmosphere storage buffer. In times of reduced breathable atmosphere (power outage), a larger habitat can provide breathable air for a longer period of time. However, a larger habitat is also more massive, consuming more fuel and payload in transit from Earth to the destination (currently recorded but not tracked).</p>\n                <p>What’s more, future versions of SIMOC will enable the scaling of your habitat to accommodate a growing community. As such, a larger, initial structure will allow the addition of crew without having to transport additional structures.</p>\n                <p><i>CREW QUARTERS are not required if no astronauts are selected.</i></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='reference-item' v-if=\"getActiveRefEntry === 'ECLSS'\">\n            <div class='reference-item-title'>\n                <fa-icon :icon=\"['fas','list-ul']\" title=\"Go to Table of Contents\" @click=\"SETACTIVEREFENTRY('Table')\"/> ECLSS\n            </div>\n            <div class='reference-item-entry'>\n                <p>An Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) is a tightly integrated, mechanical and chemical system whose function is to maintain clean air, water, and relative humidity while sustaining a comfortable temperature for <a class='reference-link' href=\"#\" @click=\"SETACTIVEREFENTRY('Inhabitants')\">human</a> occupants of a closed environment, as used on submarines, the International Space Station, and near future off-world habitats.</p>\n                <p>ECLSS modules are composed of several interconnected components, each of which is modeled in SIMOC as follows: Solid Waste Aerobic Bioreactor, MultiFiltration Purifier post-treatment, Urine recycling processor VCD, Oxygen Generation SFWE, Carbon Dioxide Removal SAWD, Particulate Removal TCCS, and Gas Control.</p>\n                <p>One ECLSS is able to support 3 human inhabitants.
