Each unit of simulated time (a \"time step\") is equivalent to one hour Earth time. Therefore a duration of 90 time steps is a simulation of 90 Earth hours. While the rotational period of each celestial body is unique from that of Earth, SIMOC is set to Earth time due to the fact that the human body is biologically set to Earth time, and the growth cycle of the available <a class='reference-link' href=\"#\" @click=\"SETACTIVEREFENTRY('PlantSpecies')\">plants</a>, as defined by data provided by NASA, is also measured in Earth time.</p>\n                <p>When establishing the duration of your mission, consider the goals and intended outcome. For example, if you are staying for just two weeks, you will not have time to raise and harvest plants. Therefore, all atmosphere, water, and waste recycling must come from the physico-chemical Environmental Control and Life Support System (<a class='reference-link' href=\"#\" @click=\"SETACTIVEREFENTRY('ECLSS')\">ECLSS</a>), as on the International Space Station.

In the real world, we would be concerned with the amount of communal and personal space the inhabitants enjoy. As SIMOC does not currently simulate psycho-social interactions, you may consider the volume of a larger space as an atmosphere storage buffer. In times of reduced breathable atmosphere (power outage), a larger habitat can provide breathable air for a longer period of time. However, a larger habitat is also more massive, consuming more fuel and payload in transit from Earth to the destination (currently recorded but not tracked). What’s more, future versions of SIMOC will enable the scaling of your habitat to accommodate a growing community. As such, a larger, initial structure will allow the addition of crew without having to transport additional structures.</p>\n                <p><i>CREW QUARTERS are not required if no astronauts are selected.</i></p>\n            </div>\n            <div class='reference-item-entry'><a class='reference-link' href=\"#\" @click=\"SETACTIVEREFENTRY('Table')\">Table Of Contents</a></div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='reference-item' v-if=\"getActiveRefEntry === 'ECLSS'\">\n            <div class='reference-item-title'>ECLSS</div>\n            <div class='reference-item-entry'>\n                <p>An Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) is a tightly integrated, mechanical and chemical machine whose function is to maintain clean air, water, and relative humidity while sustaining a comfortable temperature for <a class='reference-link' href=\"#\" @click=\"SETACTIVEREFENTRY('Inhabitants')\">human</a> occupants of a closed environment, as used on submarines, the International Space Station, and near future off-world habitats.</p>\n                <p>ECLSS modules are composed of several interconnected components, each of which is modeled in SIMOC as follows: Solid Waste Aerobic Bioreactor, MultiFiltration Purifier post-treatment, Urine recycling processor VCD, Oxygen Generation SFWE, Carbon Dioxide Reduction Sabatier, Carbon Dioxide Removal SAWD, Particulate Removal TCCS, and Gas Control.
